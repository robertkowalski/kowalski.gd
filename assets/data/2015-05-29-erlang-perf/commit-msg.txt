perf: http layer - speedup couchdb version lookup

I have taken a look at our http stack with erlang:trace and flamegraphs.
It turned out that we spend a lot of our time for ever request in the
function couch_server:get_version which simply gets the current CouchDB
version. [1]

So I tried to memoize it, with pretty good looking flamegraph. I got
good suggestions from Alex and the flamegraph also looked nice [2].

I re-benchmarked the unclustered interface, but (almost?) all our
requests are accessing this function so it should also be beneficial
for chttpd & friends.

Part of the benchmarks was also to run Apache ab and later to run
Siege [3] on it:

All benchmarks (also the flamegraph creation) were run using this test
protocol:

1. turn off all auto starting apps, especially dropbox & co
2. run make with path
3. reboot
4. wait 60secs
5. boot cluster and wait until successful connected
6. wait 60secs
7. run test

Siege:

10000 requests, concurrency 120, reading one doc, unclustered
interface:

old version, overall run times:
test 1: 4.82
test 2: 4.78

patched version, overall run times:
test 1: 4.39
test 2: 4.37

mean difference:

(4.82 + 4.78) / (4.39 + 4.37) * 100

patched version is 9.5% faster
